# Predict survival on the Titanic Disaster

In this work we will study the passengers data and apply machine learning techniques to predict a passenger's chance of surviving based on their infomration.

The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle competetion, with **"train.csv"** and **"test.csv"**. Please go to the [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) fore more details.

## Prediction files
Prediction files can be found in the solution folder. I've compared the performance with different algorithms. So far the Decision Tree has the best prediction score. For more details please check the notebook.

## Draw ##
An interactive figure was made with Dimple.js, to show the survival rate with cabinet class.

According to the analysis, cabinet Pclass, sex, Age and Fare are the most important features for predicting the survival during the disaster.
